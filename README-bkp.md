# Mobile Home Server DevTool
*A project by  [Almir Paulo](https://github.com/AlmirPaulo)*

This is a simple CLI to be runned on termux to serve a web server on your mobile device. This web server is not intended to be a production server, but a development one. The idea is to help developers to test and share their applications with their team partners or even with someone who have hired you for a job and wants to take a look at their product.

I know... I know... there are a lot of options out there to do the same. But this one is 100% free, easy an it's on your phone!
